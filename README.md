# Spam Email Classifier

## Description
A simple Naieve Bayes classifier for identifying spam and non-spam (ham) emails.

The myclassifer.py file contains my solution and the spam classifier.py implements it using the testing and training files.

This project was developed as a solution for a CM10310 Artificial Intelligence coursework. 

The estimated accuracy of the classifier with extra hidden data is 88.6%

## Installation
Python 3 is all that is required to run the code and there are no extrenal libraries.

## Usage
The purpose of this project was to develop a Naieve Bayes Classifier from scratch with no external libraries. It may be helpful for understanding a simple usage for Naieve Bayes.

## Roadmap

- Explore parallelization of calculations

	This is a common improvement to Naieve Bayes to improve performance and may be an interesting challenge. 
## Authors and acknowledgment
This solution was developed for a coursework from the University of Bath. 

They developed the spam classifier.py and training files, as well as a small section of skeleton code.
